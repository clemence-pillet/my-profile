				<h1>Hello, I am Clémence :)</h1>
				<img src="images/profile-picture.jpg" class="image-circle" alt="Moi">
				<p>Hi! My name is Clémence, and I am a first-year student at <strong>ESSEC</strong> Business School. I learned how to create this webpage thanks to a course named 'Le Wagon' (here is the link right under:). I love sport, podcasts, reading books and watching movies.

				<h2>Sport</h2>
				<p>I am passionate about sports in general, but more particularly about triathlon. I compete at a national level. I am also keen on fitness, which I have discovered and practised during the locked-down.</p>

				<h2>Podcasts</h2>
				<p>I love listening to podcasts, especially interviews of famous people. My favorite one is 'In Power' by Louise Aubery.</p>

			<div class="box-white">
				<h2>Books and films</h2>
				<p>I enjoy reading books and watching movies during my free-time. I read all kinds of books; the one that I am currently reading is about the geopolitics of the Olympic Games.</p>
